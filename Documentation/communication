Communication Pattern

1. get [ client->server ] Client is easier to handle.
2. push [ server->client ] Server needs to make sure the data has been sent exactly.

Brain Pattern
1. Actively get input [ sense ]
2. Locally compute [ queue , lock...]
3. Push result messages to actor
4. Actively get result [ check result ]



Normally "get" is better than push.

"Get" pattern is easier to retry if communication fails. 

communication protocol:
	get  ->  [ wait response ]
	send ->  
	get  ->  [ Check the  message ] [ if error ] [ retry ]
