Book: Actors : A model of concurrent computation in distributed system

Distributed Computing

computation:
	Turing Machine/Lambda Theory
	
	virtualprocessor:
	[ commonly ]scheduler [ os -> processor]

	virtualtimer:
	 sequence & parellel ==> for-loop ? while?


1. Buffered Asynchronouse Commnication.
2. A realistic model must assume that the arrival order of communication sent is both arbitrary and
   entirely unknown
3. The guarantee of delivery

A static topology: has servere limitations in representing the behavior of real system. [ dynamicly extendable ]


Paper: viewing control structures as patterns of passing messages

Actors know relations.

[ actor1 ] -friends- [ actor2 ] ... 

Actor is the basic construct of our computation model.

An actor is defined by its behavior, not bu its physical representation!

Message-driven!!
