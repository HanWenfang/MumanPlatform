Pattern 1:
	
	Blocking socket:

		[Asynchronous] One connection One reactor one thread. --use timeout to solve failure-

		[Synchronous] Many connections One reactor only one thread.

		[Half-Asynchronous] Many connections One reactor one thread.
										[ thread pool - round robin [client deals with it] ]

	Non-blocking socket:

		[Asynchronous] One connection One reactor one thread. --use timeout to solve failure-

		[Synchronous] Many connections One reactor only one thread.

		[Half-Asynchronous ] Many connections One reactor one thread.[ thread pool - round robin ]


thread pool -- no signal SIGCHLD [ EINTR ]


TReactor:
	If Descriptors' Set is empty , the TReactor turns into an timer!
