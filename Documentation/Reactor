Pattern 1:
	
	Blocking socket:

		[Asynchronous] One connection One reactor one thread. --use timeout to solve failure-

		[Synchronous] Many connections One reactor only one thread.

		[Half-Asynchronous ] Many connections One reactor one thread.[ thread pool - round robin ]

	Non-blocking socket:
		[Asynchronous] One connection One reactor one thread. --use timeout to solve failure-

		[Synchronous] Many connections One reactor only one thread.

		[Half-Asynchronous ] Many connections One reactor one thread.[ thread pool - round robin ]
